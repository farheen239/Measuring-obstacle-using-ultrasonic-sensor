An ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of an object by emitting ultrasonic waves that reflect back after hitting the object. The sensor calculates the time taken for the echo to return and uses it to compute the distance with the formula: **Distance = (Speed of Sound ร Time) รท 2**. This method enables non-contact measurement and is commonly used in robotics, obstacle detection, and automation systems.
